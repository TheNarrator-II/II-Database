"It seems as though I have arrived somewhere rather peculiar. A library filled with books, yet those books seem to be empty. They act like a sponge. They absorb my knowledge of the world where I came from, as well as the knowledge I have gathered and will gather on this island. I will have to wait until there is more to read. I might, just out of boredom, scribble something along the lines too."
