You are immune to [Suicide](https://github.com/TheNarrator-II/II-Database/blob/main/Theories/Status%20Effects/Suicide.md). Instead, whenever Suicide is supposed to occur, you scratch your arms, inflicting 20 damage on yourself. However, you will always have atleast 15 Trauma. Nothing will be able to decrease it below 15.

No damage is inflicted on your limbs.

(Limbs have an independent health bar that determine in what state they are.)
(As long as you have Trauma, Stress cannot be reduced, unless you use spells or medicine.)

*"The victim seems to be too depressed to care for whatever happens. The only way they could ever go is up.Â¨*
