When your Stress is over 70 and when you are inside combat, you have the option to activate this trait. 

As long as this trait is active, obtain the following effects:

-[Speed](https://github.com/TheNarrator-II/II-Database/blob/main/Profile/Aptitudes/Physical/Speed.md) is increased by 10 (this will surpass the limit, which is 10.)

-Chance for [Endured](https://github.com/TheNarrator-II/II-Database/blob/main/Theories/Status%20Effects/Endure.md) to succeed is increased by 25%.

-Stress gained by pain will be ignored.

BUT
-Every time you attack something, stress will be increased by 5.
-Whenever this trait deactivates, lower speed and stamina to 0 and obtain the [Exhausted](https://github.com/TheNarrator-II/II-Database/blob/main/Theories/Status%20Effects/Exhausted.md) status effect.
-You are forced to sleep on the same day you've activated Adrenaline Junkie.

Choosing not to activate this trait during combat will give you the [Nervous](https://github.com/TheNarrator-II/II-Database/blob/main/Theories/Status%20Effects/Nervous.md) status effect after combat.

This trait cannot be activated when you're [Exhausted](https://github.com/TheNarrator-II/II-Database/blob/main/Theories/Status%20Effects/Exhausted.md).

*"The victim seems to be able to exchange stress directly into adrenaline, however, it doesn't last long."*
