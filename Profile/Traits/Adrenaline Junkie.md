When your stress is over 70 and when you are inside combat, you have the option to activate this trait. 

As long as this trait is active, obtain the following effects:
-Speed is increased by 10 (this will surpass the limit, which is 10.)
-Chance for Endured to succeed is increased by 25%.
-Stress gained by pain will be ignored.
BUT
-Every time you attack something, stress will be increased by 5.
-Whenever this trait deactivates, lower speed and stamina to 0 and obtain the Exhausted status effect.
-You are forced to sleep on the same day you've activated Adrenaline Junkie.

Choosing not to activate this trait during combat will give you the Nervous status effect after combat.

This trait cannot be activated when you're Exhausted.

(Exhausted makes you unable to regain stamina, as well as making you unable to do Exhausting actions.)
(Nervous makes you unable to relieve stress.)
(Endured ensures thst the next time you receive an attack, its damage is reduced by 50%.)

*"The victim seems to be able to exchange stress directly into adrenaline, however, it doesn't last long."*
