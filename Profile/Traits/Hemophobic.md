The amount of bleeding caused by [Hemorrhage](https://github.com/TheNarrator-II/II-Database/blob/main/Theories/Status%20Effects/Hemorrhage.md) is halved, but you get stressed 2x more if you are bleeding and you start to get stressed if you are bloodied.

(Elevated amounts of stress can make you Distracted, leave you unable to sleep and less efficient while crafting.)
(When stress reaches 100, the next time you gain stress, it will turn to Trauma instead. This goes on until you decreased your stress below 60.)

*"The body and mind of the victim seem to be linked in terms of goals. The victim is irrationally scared of blood and doesn't want to bleed."*
