You hit the enemy thrice instead of once with any short melee weapon, but DT of enemy armor is 2x higher if you're attacking with a short melee weapon.

(Damage Threshold, also known as DT, deflect 90% of any damage value below the DT)

*"When agitated, the victim lashes out against the enemy. It prefers to hit them as many times as possible, rather than going for calculated shots."*
