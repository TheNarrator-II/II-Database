Gain a stackable +50% damage boost for each kill you make during combat., but you start with a -100% damage debuff (To be clear, it is halved, not 0).

This damage buff is lost after combat.

This damage buff only counts for melee attacks.

*"The victim's strength seems to be heightened when blood is present, almost as if blood fuels them to kill more."*
