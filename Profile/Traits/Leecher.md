Every time you hit an existing enemy with a magic attack, 5% of the damage you've dealt turns into blood. Every time you kill an existing enemy, you regain 2 Stamina. However, your mana penalty is doubled on all magic attacks.

(When you use a magic attack without having the required mana, you lose at least 2x the amount of health instead of the mana. This is called the mana penalty and this amount can vary between spells.)
(Blood acts like a second health bar, keeping track of the amount of blood you have in your body.)
(Stamina is required for Special Attacks, heavy attacks, intensive actions and fleeing/catching up.)

*"The patient seems to be able to suck essence out of themselves and out of enemies to sustain itself."*
