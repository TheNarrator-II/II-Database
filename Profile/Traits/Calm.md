Stress loss is doubled and trauma is lost over time, but your melee and magic attacks now only deal 75% of their total value.

(Normally, trauma can only be decreased by the use of medicine or a doctor's visit.)(This trait CANNOT co-exist with the trait Adrenaline Junkie.)

*"The victim seems to be able to cope more easily with stressful situations at hand, and is thus less likely to directly react to events."*
