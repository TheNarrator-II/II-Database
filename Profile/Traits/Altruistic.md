Whenever you Taunt the enemy, gain +20 DT and a d6 skill check. Depending on the value, you fight back when an enemy attacks you.

1-2: no attacking back.
3-4: attack back with 50% of normal damage.
5-6: attack back with 100% of normal damage.

Since you value others above you, you will suffer 10% of the damage they suffer in combat in the form of Stress.

(Damage Threshold, also known as DT, deflect 90% of any damage value below the DT)
(Taunt is a type of attack that grants its user the Targeted status effect.)
*¨The victim seems to prioritise others over itself. It will give its life for their peers.¨*
