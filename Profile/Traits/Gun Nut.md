The durability needed for a gun to start jamming randomly is decreased from 50% to 25% and attacks with gun bashing do not decrease additional durability.  However, the condition of all melee weapons used by you is decreased twice as fast.

(Normally, using your gun to bash an enemy decreases the durability by 2x, but with this trait, the multiplier changes from 2 to 1.)

*"Due to their obsession, it seems the victim knows every gun as if it were their own partner. Did no one tell them therapy was a thing?"*
