You can only lose a maximum of 50% of your current health by fall damage. However, your legs and your feet take 50% more damage.

This debuff doesn't apply when losing health to fall damage.

(As limbs lose health, they lose functionality.)
(Injured legs require more stamina to run and decrease movement speed during combat.)
(Injured feet decrease your balance, which in turn decreases (for example) your accuracy unless you're prone on the ground. It also decreases movement speed during combat.)

*"The victim's legs seem to be nimble, yet fragile. Interesting anatomy..."*
