Speed aids in... well... being fast. It isn't only a matter of having the stamina to flee, but also having the speed to flee. Or perhaps you want to catch up to an enemy. You should invest in speed if you wan to be quick in combat, have a quick reaction time towards your surroundings and if you want your travels to be somewhat shorter.

	Shorter expedition time (Also depends on the Speed of others)


"Speed wasn't our strongest suit, but it was needed nonetheless. The former member of the Republikeinse Marechaussee was quick as hell. Not just in movement speed, but also in reloading, for example, though, that was thanks to some hidden knowledge he found on the island."
