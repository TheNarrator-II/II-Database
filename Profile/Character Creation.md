Dear journal readers,
Everyone on the Island has a story, so it is time to create yours! You are free to develop your story as you wish, however, as for your character skillset, there are some rules you have to follow. This overview will go through everything you need to define your character. If, for any specific reason, you want to add an unique mechanic to your character that does not fit within these guidelines, contact the Narrator first (that's me ;P) before applying it to yourself.

Each character has the following components

FUNCTIONAL: contribute to the abilities of your character. 

Race <br>
Aptitudes <br>
[[Traits]] <br>
Background<br>
Former Faction<br>
Inventory/Starting items<br>
Spells<br>
Mana<br>
Devotion<br>

COSMETIC: do not contribute to the abilities of your character. Do whatever you want! Sky's the limit <3

Name <br>
Appearance<br>
Gender<br>
Lore<br>
Personality<br>
Alignment<br>
