When someone says life, health is the first thing you think of. Having points in Health equals having more health, as well as having more blood, which can be useful in blood sacrifices and to fight your nightmares (???). You should invest in health if you want to be tanky, not per say in the fighting part, but in the survival part, such as extreme hunger and dehydration. More blood also means you can worry less about losing it and being more open towards using it for more... unorthodox methods.

"Health is so vital, and yet my party members didnÂ´t understand that, ever. They should've been thankful that I was their medic and my close friend a Magician. We came a long way thanks to my healing and their resurrection abilities."
